## Notes

### Day 1

I created a test database on MySQL Workbench 8.0 and connected to my backend NodeJS app, Also I build a simple API that can make CRUD operations with this DB data

### Day 2 

I tried to organize the code today, I separated the frontend folder from the backend folder, created a .env file to store sensible data adding it to the .gitignore file. Also I created the React app and linked with the backend data
